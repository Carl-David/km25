        Hi! My name is Carl-David Granb√§ck, an adventurous software engineer
        with experience from both consulting-, product organizations and
        startups. Fell in love with code in the late 90s, and with people since
        day one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Positive, meticulous and adaptive. Big sense of commitment and an eye
        for details, whether it's code, content or design. Responsible and
        pragmatic approach to the profession and a tech-agnostic mindset. Likes
        trying out new stuff and creating meaningful software with snappy UIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        A good listener with social skills that thrives in global multi-cultural
        teams. Five years of international experience from studies and
        consulting work in Asia, and three years of <a
          href="https://www.swedentoafrica.com">bicycle touring</a
        > to remote corners of the planet. Crossed three continents and pedaled over
        40,000 kilometers with many lessons learned along the way.
      </p>

        Holds an M.Sc. in Software Engineering from Chalmers University of
        Technology in Sweden and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

      <h2>Company & Mindset</h2>

      <p>
        <em>KM25</em> is a remote locality situated on the coast of Western Sahara.
        It's a kitesurfing spot in a lagoon surrounded by the desert. It's named
        after being located 25 kms from the closest town, and it has a special meaning
        to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        But KM25 could also be elsewhere. An imaginary place 25 kms from
        anything. I like the abstractness of this name, along with some symbolic
        properties, so that's what I decided to call my company.
      </p>

      <Fragment slot="expanded">
        <p>
          Between 2013-2015, I spent two years <a
            href="https://www.swedentoafrica.com">cycling</a
          > from Sweden all the way down to South Africa. I passed KM25 on my way
          south and ended up staying there for a long time, and the place came to
          mean a lot to me. As I put it in my diary: <q
            ><em
              >There's really nothing here, and at same time there is so much</em
            ></q
          >. It was the kind of place that made you stop and notice the small
          things in life.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>25 kms</strong> is a distance that is doable in an hour on a bike,
          or in a day by foot. Multiply that by 4 and you get <strong
            >100 kms</strong
          >, easily rideable in one day. Multiply <em>that</em> by 4 and you will
          reach <strong>400 kms</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>That is enough to cross many countries in Europe!</p>

        <p>
          The act of <em>repeating</em>, or doing things in iterations, is
          something that is very powerful. This has always been a kind of mantra
          to me when I want to achieve something. Whether I'm digging a deep
          hole prospecting for gold or crossing continents with my own legs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This also ties into software development. By repeating the process,
          and adapting it as you go, you will reach the next milestone and
          eventually also your final goal. By splitting a problem into smaller
          pieces and acting upon them, the problem will suddenly feel much more
          doable.
        </p>

        <p>
          The act of <em>finalizing</em> things is also something that I have always
          enjoyed. Whether I do woodworking, write software, or embark on a new adventure.
          By finalizing your current task, you feel the joy of having achieved what
          you set out to do and can better focus on what comes next.
        </p>

        <p>
          To me, the cycling trip to South Africa became a very tangible way of
          realizing these two acts.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like things to have a meaning, and the idea behind the name of the
          company is that you can achieve great things by iterating and breaking
          up a challenge into smaller parts. 25 kms is a nice and manageable
          piece of distance when you cycle. Here, it's also a metaphor for the
          iterative nature of software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          The company logo was designed to be motivational. As a way of reaching
          your goals and reflect on your achievements. You can get valuable
          insights by looking in the rear-view mirror, whether you're on the
          road or developing software. The same goes for the logo. If you look
          at it upside down in a mirror (or <a
            data-flip-logo
            href="#"
            aria-label="Flip logo">click here</a
          >), you can see that it transforms into <em>KW5<sup>2</sup></em> and this
          made-up, yet symbolic "axiom" then follows:
        </p>

        <Axiom />

        <p>In other words:</p>

        <p class="text-center italic">
          The more empowered you are,<br />
          the further you'll get!
